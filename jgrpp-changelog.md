* Fix bug in earlier fix for crashes when looking at aqueducts in the viewport map mode of the enhanced viewports patch.
* Fix compilation on some compilers/platforms.

### v0.5.0 (2015-09-13)
* Add the daily/monthly/yearly scripts patch.
* Add the flat minimap screenshot patch.
* Add the extra large maps patch. (Maximum map size is now 256M tiles, ranging from 16k x 16k to 256 x 1M).
* Add the build and refit patch, with changes to make it multi-player safe.
* Fix status bar date when time in minutes and show date with time are both on.
* Fix crash when opening object picker window in scenario editor. (Introduced in trunk r27346).

* Fix crash when editing/selecting a conditional order in a non-train orders window.
* Fix crash when loading SpringPP savegame with huge airports (which should be rejected), in cases where the crash occurred before the rejection check was run.
* Scale cargodest link graph timeout and compression intervals by day length.
* Allow only one instance of house picker window, remove button toggle behaviour. This makes it behave more like the object picker window.
* (Unixy platforms) Include bin/data directory in make install target.
* Crash log improvements on MinGW and Unixy/glibc platforms (enable stack traces on MinGW, try to demangle C++ symbol names, try to use libbfd for better symbol lookup, handle SIGSEGV while backtracing).
* Bump trunk base from r27394 to r27395

### v0.4.1 (2015-09-06)
* Fix compilation on some compilers/platforms
* Fix out of date version information not always been detected and rebuilt by the build scripts (this affects the v0.4.0 windows builds posted on the thread)

### v0.4.0 (2015-09-05)
* Fix wait for cargo orders not being properly cleared when loading SpringPP games, resulting in a crash when looking at them in the orders window
* Add a company setting to enable automatic timetabling for new vehicles
* Pause the game instead of blocking when cargo dest link graph jobs lag.
* Update routing restrictions patch:
  * Program GUI changes to make 'or if' conditions easier to add, remove and use.
  * Add a 'reserve through' program command.
    If a restricted PBS signal uses this command, PBS reservations which would otherwise stop at this signal instead continue through it to the next signal/waiting point. In effect this allows the 'safe waiting point' property of a PBS signal to be conditionally turned off.
  * Improvements to the correctness and thoroughness of the program validator.
* Bump trunk base from r27389 to r27394

### v0.3.2 (2015-08-31)

* Fix bug in improved breakdown patch where config string was inserted into the middle of the stop location setting string range, resulting in an assertion failure when looking at the stop location setting in the GUI.
