  * Add a mode to show station catchment only where station window open.

* Departure boards: [imported](https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=49956)

* Automated timetables and separation: [imported](http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=46391)  
  * Auto timetabling: Bias timetable adjustment to favour negative adjustments; this is to avoid positive feedback between congestion delays and increased timetable length. Reduce jam detection threshold.  
  * Auto separation: Fix handling of non-station orders (e.g. waypoints and depots). Change to a per-vehicle setting. Add a company setting to scale vehicle lateness adjustments. No longer set vehicle lateness to 0 if separation fails, instead leave it as it was.

#### Caveats for loading savegames from the [Spring 2013 Patch Pack](http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=66892):  
* This is not guaranteed to be bug free  
* Savegames with huge airports are rejected  
* Map sizes greater than 16k x 16k are rejected  
* PAX signals/stations and traffic lights are cleared, leaving ordinary signals/stations/roads  
* Rail ageing/grass on tracks, trip histories, leave order/wait for cargo, auto advertising campaigns, base cost multipliers and other features not in this patch pack are dropped/ignored.  
* SpringPP v2.0.102/103 only:  
  * Savegames which have aircraft approaching, landing, taking off or landed at an oil rig are rejected  
  * The inflation cost multiplier is adjusted on load


#### A note on branches

Many features have two branches, the *feature* branches are just the raw features, without any modified savegame code.  
There are not generally savegame compatible with anything else, except for loading of trunk savegame versions at or before the point where the branch diverged from trunk.  
All other load attempts may result in undefined behaviour.  
The *feature-sx* branches use the savegame framework in the *save_ext* branch.


#### Compiler requirements

As of v0.15.0, C++11 support is required.

The minimum supported compiler versions are:
* GCC: 4.7
* clang: 3.3

Sufficienty up-to-date versions of other compiler toolchains including MSVC and ICC should also work.
