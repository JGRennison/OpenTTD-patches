  As of v0.5.0, fix selecting/editing conditional orders in non-train orders window.

* Include the train length and group name in the vehicle details window (added in v0.3.0)  
  This are each controlled by a setting (on by default).

* Pause the game when cargo dest link graph jobs lag (added in v0.4.0)  
  Previously if a cargo dest link graph update job took longer than permitted, the game would block until it completed, preventing all user interaction.  
  This patch instead pauses the game until the job is completed. (This does not apply to network clients, which cannot pause/unpause the game).

  * Improve cargodest link graph calculation performance. Up to approximately 33% faster. (added in v0.8.1)

  * Savegames from other branches which use the save/load code in the *save_ext* branch (usually suffixed: *-sx*) which are also merged into this branch (*jgrpp*), or where the added feature is marked as discardable/ignorable, should be loadable in this patchpack.  
  * Savegames from other patched versions are not loadable in this patchpack except for savegames from the *tracerestrict* branch ([routing restrictions patch](http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=73397)),
    and as of v0.3.0 savegames from the [Spring 2013 Patch Pack](http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=66892) v2.0, v2.1, v2.2 (subject to caveats, see below).

  Enable stack traces on MinGW, try to demangle C++ symbol names, try to use libbfd for better symbol lookup, handle SIGSEGV while backtracing.

* Multiplayer desync fixes/changes  
  * Fix YAPF pathfinder desync issue involving rail track type changes which where only passable by a subset of vehicles (trunk bug). (added in v0.6.0, fixed in trunk as of v0.7.1)  
  * Logging: Various changes and improvements to desync-related logging and debugging, see changelog for details.

#### Caveats for loading savegames from the [Spring 2013 Patch Pack](http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=66892):  
* This is not guaranteed to be bug free  
* Savegames with huge airports are rejected  
* Map sizes greater than 16k x 16k are rejected  
* PAX signals/stations and traffic lights are cleared, leaving ordinary signals/stations/roads  
* Rail ageing/grass on tracks, trip histories, leave order/wait for cargo, auto advertising campaigns, base cost multipliers and other features not in this patch pack are dropped/ignored.  
* SpringPP v2.0.102/103 only:  
  * Savegames which have aircraft approaching, landing, taking off or landed at an oil rig are rejected  
  * The inflation cost multiplier is adjusted on load


#### A note on branches

Many features have two branches, the *feature* branches are just the raw features, without any modified savegame code.  
There are not generally savegame compatible with anything else, except for loading of trunk savegame versions at or before the point where the branch diverged from trunk.  
All other load attempts may result in undefined behaviour.  
The *feature-sx* branches use the savegame framework in the *save_ext* branch.
