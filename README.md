#### This patchpack contains the following

* Routing restrictions: [thread](http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=73397)  
  As of v0.11.0 this includes the Long Reserve feature from [here](http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=74365).  
  A version of this feature rebased onto [Cirdan's new map features branch](http://repo.or.cz/w/openttd/fttd.git) is in the *tracerestrict-cirdan* branch, see [this thread](http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=58420)

* Programmable pre-signals: [imported](http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=47690)

* Realistic train braking (added in v0.40.0)  
  In this mode, trains have a stopping distance and will reserve ahead accordingly, trains cannot stop instantly.  
  This mode has many implications for signalling and track layout design, and is therefore an advanced feature which may not be suitable for beginners.  
  In particular pre-signals and two-way signals are not permitted, and PBS is used for all signalling.

#### Caveats for loading savegames from the [Spring 2013 Patch Pack](http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=66892):  
* This is not guaranteed to be bug free  
* Savegames with huge airports are rejected  
* Map sizes greater than 16k x 16k are rejected  
* PAX signals/stations and traffic lights are cleared, leaving ordinary signals/stations/roads  
* Rail ageing/grass on tracks, trip histories, leave order/wait for cargo, auto advertising campaigns, base cost multipliers and other features not in this patch pack are dropped/ignored.  
* SpringPP v2.0.102/103 only:  
  * Savegames which have aircraft approaching, landing, taking off or landed at an oil rig are rejected  
  * The inflation cost multiplier is adjusted on load

#### Caveats for loading savegames from [Joker's Patch Pack](https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=74365):  
* This is not guaranteed to be bug free  
* Logic signals are cleared, leaving ordinary signals  
* Various vehicle separation settings and partially-automatic modes are not supported.  
* Rail ageing/grass on tracks, trip histories, waiting cargo histories, station cargo punishment and other features not in this patch pack are dropped/ignored.

#### Caveats for loading savegames from [Chill's Patch Pack](https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=47622):  
* This is not guaranteed to be bug free  
* Speed signals are cleared, leaving ordinary signals  
* Various vehicle, economy, town and other settings are not supported  
* Link graph data (but not settings) is cleared  
* Train stuck counters, traffic lights and other features not in this patch pack are dropped/ignored.

#### A note on branches

Many features have two branches, the *feature* branches are just the raw features, without any modified savegame code.  
There are not generally savegame compatible with anything else, except for loading of trunk savegame versions at or before the point where the branch diverged from trunk.  
All other load attempts may result in undefined behaviour.  
The *feature-sx* branches use the savegame framework in the *save_ext* branch.


#### Compiler requirements

As of v0.15.0, C++11 support is required.

The minimum supported compiler versions are:
* GCC: 4.7
* clang: 3.3

Sufficiently up-to-date versions of other compiler toolchains including MSVC and ICC should also work.

## 1.0) About

OpenTTD is a transport simulation game based upon the popular game Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written by Chris Sawyer.
It attempts to mimic the original game as closely as possible while extending it with new features.

OpenTTD is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.0, but includes some 3rd party software under different licenses.
See the section ["Licensing"](#30-licensing) below for details.

## 1.1) Downloading OpenTTD

OpenTTD can be downloaded from the [official OpenTTD website](https://www.openttd.org/).

Both 'stable' and 'nightly' versions are available for download:

- most people should choose the 'stable' version, as this has been more extensively tested
- the 'nightly' version includes the latest changes and features, but may sometimes be less reliable

On some platforms OpenTTD will also be available via your OS package manager or a similar service.


## 1.2) OpenTTD gameplay manual

OpenTTD has a [community-maintained wiki](https://wiki.openttd.org/), including a gameplay manual and tips.


## 1.3) Supported platforms

OpenTTD has been ported to several platforms and operating systems.

The currently working platforms are:

- FreeBSD (SDL)
- Haiku (SDL)
- Linux (SDL)
- macOS (universal) (Cocoa video and sound drivers)
- OpenBSD (SDL)
- OS/2 (SDL)
- Windows (Win32 GDI (faster) or SDL)

### 1.3.1) Legacy support
Platforms, languages and compilers change.
We'll keep support going on old platforms as long as someone is interested in supporting them, except where it means the project can't move forward to keep up with language and compiler features.

We guarantee that every revision of OpenTTD will be able to load savegames from every older revision (excepting where the savegame is corrupt).
Please report a bug if you find a save that doesn't load.

## 1.4) Installing and running OpenTTD

OpenTTD is usually straightforward to install, but for more help the wiki [includes an installation guide](https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Manual/Installation).

OpenTTD needs some additional graphics and sound files to run.

For some platforms these will be downloaded during the installation process if required.

For some platforms, you will need to refer to [the installation guide](https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Manual/Installation).


### 1.4.1) Free graphics and sound files

The free data files, split into OpenGFX for graphics, OpenSFX for sounds and
OpenMSX for music can be found at:

- https://www.openttd.org/download-opengfx for OpenGFX
- https://www.openttd.org/download-opensfx for OpenSFX
- https://www.openttd.org/download-openmsx for OpenMSX

Please follow the readme of these packages about the installation procedure.
The Windows installer can optionally download and install these packages.


### 1.4.2) Original Transport Tycoon Deluxe graphics and sound files

If you want to play with the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe data files you have to copy the data files from the CD-ROM into the baseset/ directory.
It does not matter whether you copy them from the DOS or Windows version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe.
The Windows install can optionally copy these files.

You need to copy the following files:
- sample.cat
- trg1r.grf or TRG1.GRF
- trgcr.grf or TRGC.GRF
- trghr.grf or TRGH.GRF
- trgir.grf or TRGI.GRF
- trgtr.grf or TRGT.GRF


### 1.4.3) Original Transport Tycoon Deluxe music

If you want the Transport Tycoon Deluxe music, copy the appropriate files from the original game into the baseset folder.
- TTD for Windows: All files in the gm/ folder (gm_tt00.gm up to gm_tt21.gm)
- TTD for DOS: The GM.CAT file
- Transport Tycoon Original: The GM.CAT file, but rename it to GM-TTO.CAT


## 1.5) Add-on content / mods

OpenTTD features multiple types of add-on content, which modify gameplay in different ways.

Most types of add-on content can be downloaded within OpenTTD via the 'Check Online Content' button in the main menu.

Add-on content can also be installed manually, but that's more complicated; the [OpenTTD wiki](https://wiki.openttd.org/) may offer help with that, or the [OpenTTD directory structure guide](./docs/directory_structure.md).

### 1.5.1) AI opponents

OpenTTD comes without AI opponents, so if you want to play with AIs you have to download them.

The easiest way is via the 'Check Online Content' button in the main menu.

You can select some AIs that you think are compatible with your playing style.

AI help and discussions may also be found in the [AI section of the forum](https://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=65).

### 1.5.2) Scenarios and height maps

Scenarios and heightmaps can be added via the 'Check Online Content' button in the main menu.

### 1.5.3) NewGRFs

A wide range of add-content is available as NewGRFs, including vehicles, industries, stations, landscape objects, town names and more.

NewGRFs can be added via the 'Check Online Content' button in the main menu.

See also the wiki [guide to NewGRFs](https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Manual/NewGRF) and [the forum graphics development section](https://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=66).

### 1.5.4) Game scripts

Game scripts can provide additional challenges or changes to the standard OpenTTD gameplay, for example setting transport goals, or changing town growth behaviour.

Game scripts can be added via the 'Check Online Content' button in the main menu.

See also the wiki [guide to game scripts](https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Manual/Game%20script) and [the forum graphics game script section](https://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=65).

### 1.6) OpenTTD directories

OpenTTD uses its own directory structure to store game data, add-on content etc.

For more information, see the [directory structure guide](./docs/directory_structure.md).

### 1.7) Compiling OpenTTD

If you want to compile OpenTTD from source, instructions can be found in [COMPILING.md](./COMPILING.md).
