============

------
> **_NOTE:_**  Unfortunately I do not have time to continue development for this hashmap. I have a worthy successor though, please head over to: [`ankerl::unordered_dense::{map, set}`](https://github.com/martinus/unordered_dense)

> I have spent a lot of time developing and improving it `robin_hood`, and it works quite well for most use cases. I won't make any updates to this code any more, unless they are PRs for critical bug fixes.

`robin_hood::unordered_map` and `robin_hood::unordered_set` is a platform independent replacement for `std::unordered_map` / `std::unordered_set` which is both faster and more memory efficient for real-world use cases.

## Installation & Usage

### Direct Inclusion

1. Add [`robin_hood.h`](https://github.com/martinus/robin-hood-hashing/releases) to your C++ project.
1. Use `robin_hood::unordered_map` instead of `std::unordered_map`
1. Use `robin_hood::unordered_set` instead of `std::unordered_set`

### [Conan](https://conan.io/), the C/C++ Package Manager

1. Setup your `CMakeLists.txt` (see [Conan documentation](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/integrations/build_system.html) on how to use MSBuild, Meson and others) like this:
   ```CMake
   project(myproject CXX)
  
   add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} main.cpp)
  
   include(${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/conanbuildinfo.cmake) # Include Conan-generated file
   conan_basic_setup(TARGETS) # Introduce Conan-generated targets
  
   target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} CONAN_PKG::robin-hood-hashing)
   ```
1. Create `conanfile.txt` in your source dir (don't forget to update the version)
   ```ini
   [requires]
   robin-hood-hashing/3.11.5

   [generators]
   cmake
   ```
1. Install and run Conan, then build your project as always:
   ```Bash
   pip install conan
   mkdir build
   cd build
   conan install ../ --build=missing
   cmake ../
   cmake --build .
   ```
   The `robin-hood-hashing` package in Conan is kept up to date by Conan contributors. If the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index) on the `conan-center-index` repository.

## Benchmarks

Please see extensive benchmarks at [Hashmaps Benchmarks](https://martin.ankerl.com/2019/04/01/hashmap-benchmarks-01-overview/). In short: `robin_hood` is always among the fastest maps and uses far less memory than `std::unordered_map`.

## Design Choices

- **Two memory layouts**. Data is either stored in a flat array, or with node indirection. Access for `unordered_flat_map` is extremely fast due to no indirection, but references to elements are not stable. It also causes allocation spikes when the map resizes, and will need plenty of memory for large objects. Node based map has stable references & pointers (NOT iterators! Similar to [std::unordered_map](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map)) and uses `const Key` in the pair. It is a bit slower due to indirection. The choice is yours; you can either use `robin_hood::unordered_flat_map` or `robin_hood::unordered_node_map` directly. If you use `robin_hood::unordered_map` It tries to choose the layout that seems appropriate for your data.

- **Custom allocator**. Node based representation has a custom bulk allocator that tries to make few memory allocations. All allocated memory is reused, so there won't be any allocation spikes. It's very fast as well.

- **Optimized hash**. `robin_hood::hash` has custom implementations for integer types and for `std::string` that are very fast and falls back to `std::hash` for everything else.

- **Depends on good Hashing**. For a really bad hash the performance will not only degrade like in `std::unordered_map`, the map will simply fail with an `std::overflow_error`. In practice, when using the standard `robin_hood::hash`, I have never seen this happening.
