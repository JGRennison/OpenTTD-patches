This library is a C++ template library and, as such, there is no
library to build and install.  Copy the .h files and use them!

See http://code.google.com/p/cpp-btree/wiki/UsageInstructions for
details.

----

To build and run the provided tests, however, you will need to install
CMake, the Google C++ Test framework, and the Google flags package.

Download and install CMake from http://www.cmake.org

Download and build the GoogleTest framework from
http://code.google.com/p/googletest

Download and install gflags from https://code.google.com/p/gflags

Set GTEST_ROOT to the directory where GTEST was built.
Set GFLAGS_ROOT to the directory prefix where GFLAGS is installed.

export GTEST_ROOT=/path/for/gtest-x.y
export GFLAGS_ROOT=/opt

cmake . -Dbuild_tests=ON

For example, to build on a Unix system with the clang++ compiler,

export GTEST_ROOT=$(HOME)/src/googletest
export GFLAGS_ROOT=/opt
cmake . -G "Unix Makefiles" -Dbuild_tests=ON -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++

Note that this is a modified version of the original at http://code.google.com/p/cpp-btree

Changes include:
- Change size_type from ssize_t to size_t, remove remaining uses of ssize_t.
- Add cbegin, cend, crbegin, crend.
- Add contains.
- Add key_comp.
- Add move constructors/assignment.
- Add emplace, emplace_hint and try_emplace.
- No longer #define NDEBUG if unset, this can clash with other headers, test for BTREE_DEBUG being defined instead.
- Add noexcept to swap-based move constructors and copy/move assignment operator.
- Remove use of deprecated std::allocator::rebind type.
- Add support for uncopyable/move-only map/multimap values (not keys).
- Remove requirement that key/value types are default-constructible.
- Fix ambiguous comparison operator warnings/errors when compiling with C++20.
- Fix strict aliasing violation issues in struct leaf_fields.
- Do not include IO stream headers or support dumping/operator<< if BTREE_NO_IOSTREAM is defined.
- Fix formatting of benchmark results.
- Fix array bounds compiler warnings and possible undefined behaviour due to node struct size issues.
- Optimisations to reduce unnecessary pointer dereferences.
- Remove use of deprecated std::unary_function type from test code.
- Improve performance of range erase operations.
- Add erase_count and erase_count_if methods for range erase and range erase with predicate.

CMakeLists-pthreads-fix.txt is a modified copy of CMakeLists.txt which includes -lpthreads when building the tests/benchmarks.
Using this instead fixes compilation on some platforms.
