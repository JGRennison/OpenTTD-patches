/**
 * Template class for all TimerGame based timers. As Calendar and Economy are very similar, this class is used to share code between them.
 *
 * IntervalTimer and TimeoutTimer based on this Timer are a bit unusual, as their count is always one.
 * You create those timers based on a transition: a new day, a new month or a new year.
 *
 * Additionally, you need to set a priority. To ensure deterministic behaviour, events are executed
 * in priority. It is important that if you assign NONE, you do not use Random() in your callback.
 * Other than that, make sure you only set one callback per priority.
 *
 * For example:
 *   IntervalTimer<TimerGameCalendar>({TimerGameCalendar::DAY, TimerGameCalendar::Priority::NONE}, [](uint count) {});
 *
 * @note Callbacks are executed in the game-thread.
