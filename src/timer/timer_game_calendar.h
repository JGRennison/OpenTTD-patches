/**
 * Timer for calendar days / months / years.
 *
 * Calendar time is used for technology and time-of-year changes, including:
 * - Vehicle, airport, station, object introduction and obsolescence
 * - NewGRF variables for visual styles or behavior based on year or time of year (e.g. variable snow line)
 * - Inflation, since it is tied to original game years. One interpretation of inflation is that it compensates for faster and higher capacity vehicles,
 *   another is that it compensates for more established companies. Each of these point to a different choice of calendar versus economy time, but we have to pick one
 *   so we follow a previous decision to tie inflation to original TTD game years.
