	<h3 id="feature-test">Action 14 - Feature Tests</h3>
	<p>See <a href="https://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/Action14">Action 14 Specification</a> for background information.</p>
	<h4 id="FTST">Feature Test: C "FTST"</h4>
	<p>Each FTST chunk (type C) describes an individual feature test.<br />
	Sub-chunks within each FTST chunk may appear in any order, however each sub-chunk SHOULD only appear ONCE within an individual FTST chunk.</p>
	<p>Feature tests can be safely used on implementations which do not implement the described feature test mechanism because unknown Action 14 blocks are ignored,
		and the observable result (in global variable 0x9D) is equivalent to the case where all feature tests have failed, indicating that the feature is not present.</p>
	<h4 id="FTST-NAME">Feature Name: C "FTST" -> T "NAME"</h4>
	<p>Within an FTST chunk, the NAME text (type T) field contains the name of the feature to test for. The value of the language ID byte is ignored.<br />
	If the named feature is not present, or if this field is omitted, the version is 0.<br />
	If the named feature is present, the version number will be at least 1.</p>
	<p>The feature testing mechanism itself has the feature name: <font face="monospace">feature_test</font>, this document describes version 1.</p>
	<h4 id="FTST-MINV">Feature Minimum Version: C "FTST" -> B "MINV"</h4>
	<p>Within an FTST chunk, the MINV binary (type B) field contains the minimum (inclusive) (&ge;) version to accept. This is a Word (2 bytes).<br />
	The default value is 1.</p>
	<h4 id="FTST-MAXV">Feature Maximum Version: C "FTST" -> B "MAXV"</h4>
	<p>Within an FTST chunk, the MAXV binary (type B) field contains the maximum (inclusive) (&le;) version to accept. This is a Word (2 bytes).<br />
	The default value is 0xFFFF (no maximum).</p>
	<h4 id="FTST-SETP">Feature Set Global Variable 0x9D Bit: C "FTST" -> B "SETP"</h4>
	<p>Within an FTST chunk, the SETP binary (type B) field contains the bit number to set/clear in
		<a href="https://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/GlobalVariables">global variable</a> 0x9D (TTD Platform) to store the result of the test. This is 1 byte.<br />
	If the test is successful, the bit is set (to 1), otherwise the bit is cleared (to 0).<br />
	The bit number MUST be in the range: 4 &le; bit number &le; 31. These bits can be assumed to be 0 on implementations which do not support this feature test mechanism.<br />
	Global variable 0x9D can then be tested by using a standard <a href="https://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/Action7">Action 7 or 9</a>, or a standard <a href="https://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/VariationalAction2">Variational Action 2</a>.<br />
	If this field is omitted, no bit is set or cleared, and the test is not observable (unless the SVAL chunk is used).
	</p>
	<h4 id="FTST-SVAL">Feature Set Global Variable 0x91 Success Test Value: C "FTST" -> B "SVAL"</h4>
	<p>Within an FTST chunk, the SVAL binary (type B) field contains a 32 bit value which can be tested using the mechanism below. This is 4 bytes.<br />
	If the test is successful, the value is added to a list of successful result values which can be checked using the mechanism below.<br />
	If the test is unsuccessful, no action is taken.<br />
	The value must be &gt; 0, a value of 0 has no effect.</p>
	<p>To check if the test succeeded (the value has been added to the list of successful result values), use <a href="https://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/Action7">Action 7 or 9</a>.<br />
	The parameter to test is global variable 0x91 (this always has a value of 0, equivalent to the case where the test has failed, if this feature test mechanism is not present).<br />
	The condition-type to use is: 02 (\7=, equality) to jump if the value is in the list (the test succeeded), or 03 (\7!, inequality) to jump if the value is not in the list (the test did not succeed).<br />
	The value in the Action 7 or 9 must match the value specified in this SVAL chunk.
	</p>
	<p>If this field is omitted, the test is not observable (unless the SETP chunk is used).</p>
	<p>This chunk and the associated test mechanism requires the feature name: <font face="monospace">feature_test</font>, version 2.<br />
	Using this chunk instead or as well as SETP allows observing the result of more than 28 feature tests.</p>

	<h3 id="property-mapping">Action 14 - Property Mapping for Action 0</h3>
	<p>See <a href="https://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/Action14">Action 14 Specification</a> and <a href="https://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/Action0">Action 0 Specification</a> for background information.</p>
	<p>The property mapping mechanism has the feature name: <font face="monospace">property_mapping</font>, this document describes version 1.</p>
	<p>Users of this mechanism SHOULD at minimum test for the presence of the feature above or test variable 8D, below.</p>
	<h4 id="A0PM">Property Mapping: C "A0PM"</h4>
	<p>Each A0PM chunk (type C) describes an individual property mapping.<br />
	Sub-chunks within each A0PM chunk may appear in any order, however except where otherwise noted each sub-chunk SHOULD only appear ONCE within an individual A0PM chunk.</p>
	<p>Property mapping can be safely used on implementations which do not implement the property mapping mechanism if Action 0 sprites which use mapped property IDs are skipped if one or more of:
		<ul>
			<li>The global variable 0x8D is checked to determine whether the property mapping operation was successful.</li>
			<li>The feature name <font face="monospace">property_mapping</font> is checked for.</li>
		</ul>
		Unknown Action 14 blocks are ignored, and do not need to be skipped.</p>
	<h4 id="A0PM-NAME">Property Name: C "A0PM" -> T "NAME"</h4>
	<p>Within an A0PM chunk, the NAME text (type T) field contains the name of the property to map. The value of the language ID byte is ignored.</p>
	<h4 id="A0PM-FEAT">Action 0 Feature ID: C "A0PM" -> B "FEAT"</h4>
	<p>Within an A0PM chunk, the FEAT binary (type B) field contains the <a href="https://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/Action0#Feature">Action 0 feature ID</a>. This is 1 byte.</p>
	<h4 id="A0PM-PROP">Property ID: C "A0PM" -> B "PROP"</h4>
	<p>Within an A0PM chunk, the PROP binary (type B) field contains the property ID to allocate to the named property, this value can used in Action 0 sprites. This is 1 byte.<br />
	It is possible to override existing properties, however this use is not recommended.</p>
	<h4 id="A0PM-SETT">Success Indicator Global Variable 0x8D Bit: C "A0PM" -> B "SETT"</h4>
	<p>Within an A0PM chunk, the SETT binary (type B) field contains the bit number to set/clear in
		<a href="https://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/GlobalVariables">global variable</a> 0x8D (TTD version) to store whether the mapping operation was successful. This is 1 byte.<br />
	If the operation is successful, the bit is set (to 1), otherwise the bit is cleared (to 0).<br />
	The bit number MUST be in the range: 4 &le; bit number &le; 31. These bits can be assumed to be 0 on implementations which do not support this property mapping mechanism.<br />
	Global variable 0x8D can then be tested by using a standard <a href="https://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/Action7">Action 7 or 9</a>, or a standard <a href="https://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/VariationalAction2">Variational Action 2</a>.<br />
	If this field is omitted, no bit is set or cleared.
	</p>
	<h4 id="A0PM-SVAL">Success Indicator Global Variable 0x91 Test Value: C "A0PM" -> B "SVAL"</h4>
	<p>This behaves identically to the <a href="#FTST-SVAL">C "FTST" -> B "SVAL"</a> case, above</p>
	<p>This chunk and the associated test mechanism requires the feature name: <font face="monospace">property_mapping</font>, version 2.</p>
	<h4 id="A0PM-FLBK">Fallback Mode: C "A0PM" -> B "FLBK"</h4>
	<p>Within an A0PM chunk, the FLBK binary (type B) field contains the fallback mode. This is 1 byte.<br />
	The fallback mode may take the following values:
	<table>
		<tr><th>Value</th><th>Behaviour</th></tr>
		<tr><td>0</td><td>Attempts to map an unknown property name are ignored. Use of the mapped property in an Action 0 is ignored. This is the default.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>Attempts to map an unknown property name are ignored. Use of the mapped property in an Action 0 is an error.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Attempting to map an unknown property name is an error.</td></tr>
	</table>
	Attempts to set a fallback mode other than those listed above are silently ignored. More fallback modes MAY be added in future versions of this mechanism.<br />
	This chunk MAY be specified more than once, in which case the last specified valid value is used.<br />
	Note that even when using fallback mode 0, above, if the property mapping feature is not present, then use of the mapped property ID in an Action 0 is an error.
	</p>
	<h4 id="A0PM-format">Format of remapped properties</h4>
	All properties which are mapped by this mechanism have the format:
	<table>
	<tr><th>Size</th><th>Name</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
	<tr><td>B*</td><td>num</td><td>Size of the data in bytes</td></tr>
	<tr><td>V</td><td>data</td><td>Property data</td></tr>
	</table>
	Note that num is an extended byte, see <a href="https://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/GRFActionsDetailed">GRFActionsDetailed</a>.<br />
	If the size of the data provided is not valid for the given property, the attempt to set the property MAY be ignored or partially applied.<br />
	Note that each use of the mapped property ID is followed by Num-info iterations of the size and data pair above. See: <a href="https://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/Action0">Action 0 Specification</a>.
	<h4 id="A0PM-example">Example NFO:</h4>

	<h3 id="variable-mapping">Action 14 - Variable Mapping for Variational Action 2</h3>
	<p>See <a href="https://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/Action14">Action 14 Specification</a> and <a href="https://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/VariationalAction2">Variational Action 2 Specification</a> for background information.</p>
	<p>The variable mapping mechanism has the feature name: <font face="monospace">variable_mapping</font>, this document describes version 1 (and where indicated, version 2).</p>
	<p>Unlike property mappings, it is not necessary to perform a feature test or check a mapping success variable before using a mapped variable.</p>
	<p>Remapped variables are accessed by reading from variable 0x11 using a varadjust shift-num and and-mask which exactly matches that specified in the variable mapping.<br />
	In the absence of any successful variable mapping, variable 0x11 has all bits set to 0 and attempting to read from it with any shift-num and and-mask value
	results in a value of 0 without producing an error.</p>
	<p>Reading a mapped variable on a version of OpenTTD which does not support this variable mapping mechanism or which does not support the requested variable, returns a value of 0.</p>
	<p>If more than one variable mapping is made for the same combination of feature ID, shift-num and and-mask, it is implementation-defined which mapping is used.<br />
	Each variable mapping SHOULD use a unique combination of feature ID, shift-num and and-mask.</p>
	<p>From version 2 of the <font face="monospace">variable_mapping</font> feature name, variable remapping can also be used with variable 0x7B.<br />
	In this case the parameter of variable 0x7B should be set to 0x11, and the shift and mask fields set the same way in the direct 0x11 variable case.<br />
	The "VPRM" parameter field is ignored, and the parameter used is the accumulator of the previous adjust part in the usual way for variable 0x7B.</p>
	<h4 id="A2VM">Variable Mapping: C "A2VM"</h4>
	<p>Each A2VM chunk (type C) describes an individual variable mapping.<br />
	Sub-chunks within each A2VM chunk may appear in any order, however each sub-chunk SHOULD only appear ONCE within an individual A2VM chunk.</p>
	<p>Unknown Action 14 blocks are ignored, and do not need to be skipped.</p>
	</p>
	<h4 id="A2VM-NAME">Property Name: C "A2VM" -> T "NAME"</h4>
	<p>Within an A2VM chunk, the NAME text (type T) field contains the name of the variable to map. The value of the language ID byte is ignored.</p>
	<h4 id="A2VM-FEAT">Action 0 Feature ID: C "A2VM" -> B "FEAT"</h4>
	<p>Within an A2VM chunk, the FEAT binary (type B) field contains the <a href="https://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/VariationalAction2#Feature">Variational Action 2 feature ID</a>. This is 1 byte.</p>
	<p>In the case where a parent/related scope is used to access a different feature (e.g. the town feature as the parent scope for objects),
	the feature ID used here is that associated with the scope where the variable is used.<br />
	To map a town variable, the feature ID should be the result of mapping the "town" feature name using the <a href="#feature-id-mapping">feature mapping mechanism</a>,
	this is not necessarily the feature ID used directly in the variational action 2.</p>
	</p>
	<h4 id="A2VM-RSFT">Shift to replace: C "A2VM" -> B "RSFT"</h4>
	<p>Within an A2VM chunk, the RSFT binary (type B) field contains the Variational Action 2 varadjust shift-num value to look for. This is 1 byte.<br />
	The shift-num value must be &lt; 32 (0x20).<br />
	If this is not specified, a value of 0 is assumed.</p>
	<h4 id="A2VM-RMSK">Mask to replace: C "A2VM" -> B "RMSK"</h4>
	<p>Within an A2VM chunk, the RMSK binary (type B) field contains the Variational Action 2 varadjust and-mask value to look for. This is 4 bytes.<br />
	When using byte or word sized variational action 2s, the and-mask is zero-extended to 32 bits before comparing with this value.<br />
	If this is not specified, a value of 0 is assumed.</p>
	<h4 id="A2VM-VSFT">Replacement shift: C "A2VM" -> B "VSFT"</h4>
	<p>Within an A2VM chunk, the VSFT binary (type B) field contains the replacement Variational Action 2 varadjust shift-num value to use on the mapped variable. This is 1 byte.<br />
	The shift-num value must be &lt; 32 (0x20).<br />
	If this is not specified, a value of 0 is assumed.</p>
	<h4 id="A2VM-VMSK">Replacement mask: C "A2VM" -> B "VMSK"</h4>
	<p>Within an A2VM chunk, the RMSK binary (type B) field contains the replacement Variational Action 2 varadjust and-mask value to use on the mapped variable. This is 4 bytes.<br />
	If this is not specified, a value of 0 is assumed.</p>
	<h4 id="A2VM-SETT">Success Indicator Global Variable 0x8D Bit: C "A2VM" -> B "SETT"</h4>

	<p>This behaves identically to the <a href="#FTST-SVAL">C "FTST" -> B "SVAL"</a> case, above</p>
	<p>This chunk and the associated test mechanism requires the feature name: <font face="monospace">variable_mapping</font>, version 3.</p>
	<h4 id="A2VM-VPRM">Replacement parameter: C "A2VM" -> B "VPRM"</h4>
	<p>Within an A2VM chunk, the VPRM binary (type B) field contains the Variational Action 2 parameter value (as in 60+X variables) to use on the mapped variable. This is 4 bytes.<br />
	If this is not specified, a value of 0 is assumed.<br />
	Support for this field is indicated by the feature name <font face="monospace">variable_mapping</font>, version 2.</p>

	<p>See the <a href="https://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/VariationalAction2#Type">Variational Action 2 Specification (types)</a> for background information.</p>
	<p>This feature adds the type value 87, for additional variation action 2 modes/scopes. (This is used instead of the standard values: 81, 82, 85, 86, 89 or 8A).<br />
	An additional byte follows to specify which sub-type.</p>

	<p>Variational Action 2 variables 10, 18 and 40 are available and have the same format as in <a href="https://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/VariationalAction2/Railtypes">VariationalAction2/Railtypes</a>.</p>
	<p>Rail type custom signal sprites have a higher priority than custom signal sprites for all signals as set here.</p>
	<p>Note that this is not a generic callback, the sprite group must be assigned to ID 0 (further IDs may be allocated for other purposes in future).
	<br />Cargo type definitions are not used. Only the default set ID is used.</p>

	<p>The action 5 type ID mapping mechanism has the feature name: <font face="monospace">action5_type_id_mapping</font>, this document describes version 1.</p>
	<p>Users of this mechanism SHOULD at minimum test for the presence of the feature above or test variable 8D, below.</p>
	<h4 id="A5TM">Action 5 type ID Mapping: C "A5TM"</h4>
	<p>Each A5TM chunk (type C) describes an individual action 5 type ID mapping.<br />
	Sub-chunks within each A5TM chunk may appear in any order, however except where otherwise noted each sub-chunk SHOULD only appear ONCE within an individual A5TM chunk.</p>
	<p>Action 5 type ID mapping can be safely used on implementations which do not implement the type ID mapping mechanism if Action 5 sprites which use mapped type IDs are skipped if one or more of:
		<ul>
			<li>The global variable 0x8D is checked to determine whether the type ID mapping operation was successful.</li>
			<li>The feature name <font face="monospace">action5_type_id_mapping</font> is checked for.</li>
		</ul>
		Unknown Action 14 blocks are ignored, and do not need to be skipped.</p>
	<h4 id="A5TM-NAME">Property Name: C "A5TM" -> T "NAME"</h4>
	<p>Within an A5TM chunk, the NAME text (type T) field contains the name of the type to map. The value of the language ID byte is ignored.</p>
	<h4 id="A5TM-TYPE">Property ID: C "A5TM" -> B "TYPE"</h4>
	<p>Within an A5TM chunk, the TYPE binary (type B) field contains the type ID to allocate to the named type, this value can used in Action 5 sprites. This is 1 byte. The value MUST be &lt; 128 (i.e bit 7 must be clear).<br />
	It is possible to override existing type IDs, however this use is not recommended.</p>
	<h4 id="A5TM-SETT">Success Indicator Global Variable 0x8D Bit: C "A5TM" -> B "SETT"</h4>
	<p>This behaves identically to the <a href="#A0PM-SETT">C "A0PM" -> B "SETT"</a> case, above</p>

	<p>The feature ID mapping mechanism has the feature name: <font face="monospace">feature_id_mapping</font>, this document describes version 1.</p>
	<p>Users of this mechanism SHOULD at minimum test for the presence of the feature above or test variable 8D, below.</p>
	<h4 id="FIDM">Feature ID Mapping: C "FIDM"</h4>
	<p>Each FIDM chunk (type C) describes an individual feature ID mapping.<br />
	Sub-chunks within each FIDM chunk may appear in any order, however except where otherwise noted each sub-chunk SHOULD only appear ONCE within an individual FIDM chunk.</p>
	<p>Feature ID mapping can be safely used on implementations which do not implement the feature ID mapping mechanism if all sprites which use mapped feature IDs are skipped if one or more of:
		<ul>
			<li>The global variable 0x8D is checked to determine whether the feature ID mapping operation was successful.</li>
			<li>The feature name <font face="monospace">feature_id_mapping</font> is checked for.</li>
		</ul>
		Unknown Action 14 blocks are ignored, and do not need to be skipped.</p>
	<p>After this mapping, the mapped feature ID value can used in all sprites which expect a feature ID (including Action 0, Action 1, Action 2, Action 3, Action 4, Action D, Action 14).</p>
	<p><b>Note that implementations which are not aware of a particular feature ID and which do not implement the feature ID mapping mechanism will automatically skip sprites with unknown feature IDs.<br />
	However: if/when the specification and/or the implementation assigns the chosen feature ID to an unrelated feature in future, sprites using that feature will not be skipped.<br />
	This means that the GRF has the potential to inexplicably fail in the distant future if the sprites are not correctly skipped.<br />
	Do not rely on the behaviour where unknown feature IDs are skipped.</b></p>
	<h4 id="FIDM-NAME">Property Name: C "FIDM" -> T "NAME"</h4>
	<p>Within an FIDM chunk, the NAME text (type T) field contains the name of the feature to map. The value of the language ID byte is ignored.</p>
	<h4 id="FIDM-FTID">Property ID: C "FIDM" -> B "FTID"</h4>
	<p>Within an FTID chunk, the FTID binary (type B) field contains the feature ID to allocate to the named feature. This is 1 byte.<br />
	Note that the remapped feature ID can only be used after this FIDM chunk in the GRF. It is not applied retrospectively to sprites earlier in the GRF file, or earlier parts of the current Action 14 sprite.<br />
	It is possible to override existing feature IDs, however this use is STRONGLY NOT RECOMMENDED (except in the specific case below) due to a high potential for confusion when your code is inspected by someone else.<br />
	At the time of writing known existing feature IDs include the values: 0x00 - 0x14 (inclusive) and 0x48.</p>
	<p>The interface for feature 0x14 (road stops) is mostly equivalent to that of the "roadstops" feature name, therefore it is reasonable to map the "roadstops" feature name to ID 0x14, such that both interfaces can be supported simultaneously.</p>
